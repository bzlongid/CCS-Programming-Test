# CCS-Programming-Test

Hi all! Out of transparency, I'm reaching the 6 hour mark on this assignment and have not been able to finish. Due to my lack of equiptment, I've spent the last few hours playing with the simulator and attempting to debug the code I have so far. While I didn't get to finish, I'm grateful for the opportunity to explore a new challenge and will defenitely continue working on learning VR!

With that being said, here's my description on...

# How to Use the (Very Basic<sup>TM</sup>) Level Editor
* To spawn a new object, click the appropriate button on the UI
* The object will spawn in front of the player (first person level editor)

## I'll also include some notes on how I would approach the rest of the project...
* Grabbing objects would allow you to adjust the placement and rotation (object prefabs would be grabbable)
* Letting go of objects would freeze their position and rotation
* Toggling a designated locomote UI button would change the player's movement abilities
* Saving and Loading scenes would be handled by another screen/scene made of purely UI and a Scene Management system
